# Screenshots Directory

This directory is for storing screenshots of the ZImage Enterprise application that will be used in the main README.md documentation.

## Expected Screenshots

Please add the following screenshots to enhance the documentation:

1. `main-screenshot.png` - Main application window showing the overall interface
2. `browser-screenshot.png` - Browser tab with thumbnails and/or fullscreen view
3. `editor-screenshot.png` - Editor tab showing drawing tools
4. `resizer-screenshot.png` - Resizer tab with batch functionality
5. `collage-screenshot.png` - Collage creator with multiple images
6. `meme-creator-screenshot.png` - Meme Creator with text overlay

## How to Take Screenshots

1. Run the application: `python -m zimage.main`
2. Navigate to the relevant tab/feature
3. Arrange the content to best showcase the feature
4. Take a screenshot using your system's screenshot tool
   - Windows: Press `Win+Shift+S` or use Snipping Tool
   - macOS: Press `Cmd+Shift+4` or use Screenshot app
   - Linux: Use tools like Flameshot, GNOME Screenshot, etc.
5. Save the screenshot with the appropriate name from the list above
6. Place the file in this directory

## Guidelines for Good Screenshots

- Ensure the application window is cleanly visible
- Try to showcase actual functionality, not just empty interfaces
- Include example images where relevant
- Crop to a reasonable size (1280x720 or similar is good)
- Use PNG format for better quality
